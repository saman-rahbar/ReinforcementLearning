    "The answer is that it is due to randomness in the environment and in the agent. Depending on what action the agent randomly starts with, or when it randomly chooses to explore, it can change the results of the runs. And even if the agent chooses the same action, the reward from the environment is randomly sampled from a Gaussian. The agent could get lucky, and see larger rewards for the best action early on and so settle on the best action faster. Or, it could get unlucky and see smaller rewards for best action early on and so take longer to recognize that it is in fact the best action.\n",
